      Autism
             <div class="description"> <br> <br> Autism is a complicated condition that includes problems with communication and behavior.

      Dyslexia
            <div class="description"> <br> <br> All kids struggle at times to pay attention, listen and follow directions, sit still, or wait their turn. But for kids with ADHD, the struggles are harder and happen more often. This may make them inattentive, hyperactive, impulsive. Hence, when interacting with them, give them more leeway and be more forgiving! They are just like us after all! </div>

      Muscular Dystrophy
            <div class="description"> <br> <br> We all know learning is difficult. But for people with dyslexia, it is even more challenging for them. Dyslexia is a specific learning disability that makes it difficult for them to read, write and/or spell. It has nothing to do with the personâ€™s intelligence. In fact, our founding prime minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew has dyslexia but look at the wonderful things he has achieved regardless.</div>
